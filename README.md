# Calibrew

Calibrew is an interactive tool designed to help coffee enthusiasts and baristas dial in their espresso shots with minimal waste.

## Use-case

Dialing in espresso is the process of calibrating an espresso machine and coffee grinder to achieve the perfect shot. It involves carefully adjusting several key parameters:

- Dose (ground coffee weight)
- Yield (brewed espresso amount)
- Brew time
- Grind size
- Water temperature (if it's not regulated by the machine)

Getting these parameters right is necessary for extracting the desired flavor from coffee beans. This process is necessary for every new batch of coffee beans, as well as after any major changes to the equipment.

Usually, this process is done by trial and error and requires many wasted coffee beans. This tool aims to make the process quicker and waste less coffee.
